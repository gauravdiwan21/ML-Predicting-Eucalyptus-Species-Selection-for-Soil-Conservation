# Predicting-Eucalyptus-Species-Selection-for-Soil-Conservation


The objective was to determine which seedlots in a species are best for soil conservation in seasonally dry hill country. Determination is found by measurement of height, diameter by height, survival, and other contributing factors. The dataset was sourced from the openMl at https://openml.org/d/188.
